Hello!

Welcome to our CodeTN website.

This is a proof of concept of SyNap.

## SyNap

SyNap is a learning tool designed specifically for self motivated students, contrary to the public schools system. It is based on the belief that students reach their maximum potential when they are given the ample tools and inspiration. Our system has no tests, only projects. Individuals learn by performing projects they find interesting. If they need help, plentiful resources are easily accessible: teachers, articles, or interactive tools.

This allows students to study what they find interesting, and what is appropriate for the real world. Teaching real world applications is arguably the most important part of teaching, because that is what fuels student motivations. Without it, students would stop caring the second they graduate.

However, with SyNap, students who enjoy a subject area will not be limited by a classroom or a textbook. The teacher will answer questions, and very low stress projects are implemented so a student actually learns something rather than just preparing for a test.

For an example course, we have Sort[101]. This is a program that vizualizes and emulates sorting alogrithms. Students are encouraged to find or generate new alogrithms.

### Sort[101]

SyNap would simply be a platform for teachers to host classes on. While SyNap would be tailored for computer-oriented classes, it could be used for any course.

In this example, there are colorized bars that represent:

  * Orange: sorted, (or starting position)
  * Gray: being switched
  * Red: is larger than the bar before it (out of order)

Students can write code (or look at examples) to sort arrays. There are animated examples, but there are also examples which take the minimum amount of time.


## Technical

We use GH-Pages (for website hosting), Jekyll (for static site generator), Google Charts (for visualizing), and JavaScript (for running sorting algorithms).
