Hello!

Welcome to our CodeTN website.

This is a proof of concept of Synap.

Synap is a learning tool designed specifically for self motivated students, contrary to the public schools system. It is based on the belief that students reach their maximum potential when they are given the ample tools and inspiration. Our system has no tests, only projects. Individuals learn by performing projects they find interesting. If they need help, plentiful resources are easily accessible: teachers, articles, or interactive tools.

For this example, we have Sort[101]. This is a program that vizualizes and emulates sorting alogrithms. Students are encouraged to find or generate new alogrithms.

We use Jekyll (for website hosting), Google Charts (for visualizing), and JavaScript (for running sorting algorithms).
